# Product Vision: [Product Name]

## North Star

[One inspiring sentence. Not a paragraph — a sentence that anyone on the
team can repeat from memory.]

## Target Users

### Primary

[Specific enough to recognize in a room. Not "developers" — say what
kind of developer, at what stage, facing what situation.]

### Secondary

[Who else benefits? What's their relationship to the primary user?]

## Core Problem

[What pain exists today? Include evidence — not just an assumption but
something observed, measured, or reported.]

**Evidence:** [Interview, support ticket, analytics, observation]

## Value Proposition

[Why would someone switch from their current solution? What's the pull
— not features, but the shift in their experience or capability.]

## Standout Capabilities

[3-5 capabilities (not features) that make this product distinctive.
Each should be a thing the product enables, not a thing it has.]

1. [Capability] — [Why it matters]
2. [Capability] — [Why it matters]
3. [Capability] — [Why it matters]

## Success Criteria

### Business

[Measurable outcome with a number and timeframe.]

### User

[Observable behavior change with a metric.]

## What This Is NOT

[At least 2 specific anti-goals. Things stakeholders might assume are
in scope but are deliberately excluded.]

1. [Anti-goal] — [Why excluded]
2. [Anti-goal] — [Why excluded]

## Open Questions

[Anything surfaced during the workshop that needs resolution.
Remove this section if none.]

- [Question]
```
