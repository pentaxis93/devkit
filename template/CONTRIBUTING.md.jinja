# Contributing to {{ project_name }}

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your keys
3. Install dependencies (see README.md)

## Development Workflow

### Branching

- All changes via pull requests -- never commit directly to `main`
- Branch prefixes: `feature/`, `fix/`, `docs/`, `refactor/`, `chore/`

### Commits

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
feat: add user authentication
fix: handle empty input in search
docs: update API reference
refactor: extract validation logic
chore: update dependencies
```

Use the `/commit` skill for guided commit message creation.

### Planning Pipeline

This project uses a structured planning-to-execution pipeline:

1. `/vision-workshop` -- Capture project or feature vision
2. `/feature-discovery` -- Break vision into features
3. `/journey-mapping` -- Map user journeys with scenarios
4. `/beads-plan` -- Decompose epics into tasks
5. `/beads-execute` -- Execute tasks

### Decision Records

Record significant decisions in `docs/decisions/` using MADR format.
See existing decisions for examples. Number sequentially (0001, 0002, ...).

## Code Review

- All PRs require review before merge
- Use the `/find-bugs` skill for automated review
