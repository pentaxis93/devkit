# {{ project_name }}

## Quick Reference

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Build | `TODO` |
| Test | `TODO` |
| Lint | `TODO` |

## Credential Hygiene

- Never read credential values into conversation context
- Verify credentials exist without exposing: `pass show X > /dev/null && echo "exists"`
- If credentials are accidentally exposed, immediately advise rotation

## Git Workflow

- All changes via pull requests. Never commit directly to `main`.
- Branch prefixes: `feature/`, `fix/`, `docs/`, `refactor/`, `chore/`
- After creating PR: switch to `main`, delete local feature branch.

## Code Style

- TODO: Add project-specific conventions here

## Gotchas

- TODO: Add project-specific gotchas as they're discovered
