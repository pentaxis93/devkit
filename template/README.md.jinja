## Development Environment

This project uses a structured planning-to-execution pipeline powered by AI agent skills. The `.claude/skills/` directory contains 23 reusable agent skills covering:

- **Planning layer**: Vision workshop, feature discovery, journey mapping
- **Execution layer**: Beads planning and execution with BDD workflows
- **Supporting tools**: Quality gates, coherence audits, commit discipline

## Getting Started

### Planning

The planning pipeline produces markdown artifacts in `planning/`:

1. **Vision** (`planning/vision.md`) - Product vision using Product Vision Board methodology
2. **Features** (`planning/features.md`) - Feature discovery with Opportunity Solution Trees
3. **Journeys** (`planning/journeys/*.md`) - User journeys with Gherkin scenarios and epic definitions

Start with `/vision-workshop` to create your first planning artifact.

### Execution

The execution layer uses beads (task management) to decompose and execute epics:

```bash
# Initialize beads in your project
bd init

# Plan an epic from a journey file
# (use /beads-plan skill in your agent)

# Execute beads
# (use /beads-execute skill in your agent)
```

### Documentation

Architecture decisions live in `docs/decisions/` using the MADR format. Start new decisions with sequential numbering (0001, 0002, etc.).

## Skills Reference

See `.claude/skills/README.md` for the full catalog of available agent skills and their usage.
