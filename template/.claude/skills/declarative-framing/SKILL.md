# Declarative Framing Skill

Factor complex decisions so humans reason at the principle level and agents
derive consequences. Based on Two Sovereignties applied to decision-making.

## The Fundamental Insight

**Every complex choice entangles two dimensions: exigence and principle.**

- **Exigence** -- the situation, the constraints, the facts on the ground
- **Principle** -- the stance, value, or methodological preference for how
  to respond to that situation

The default presentation fuses these into pre-computed options: "Here are
three approaches, pick one." Each option is a fait accompli -- a principle
already married to an exigence. The human cannot see which part is "the
world as it is" and which part is "how I want to respond to it."

Factoring them apart lets each sovereign operate cleanly:

- The human chooses principles (their sovereignty)
- The agent derives what follows from those principles (its sovereignty)
- Neither tiptoes at the other's boundary

## Why This Works

Three things happen when you factor principle from exigence:

1. **The human reasons at the level they are sovereign over.** No risk of
   accidentally overstepping into implementation. No tiptoeing at boundaries.
   This is experienced as liberation.

2. **Structural relationships become visible.** Options that appeared to
   compete may reveal themselves as complementary layers of one system.
   Options that appeared equivalent may reveal fundamentally different
   worldviews. This is invisible in the entangled form.

3. **The human experiences agency, not selection.** The entangled version
   feels like a multiple-choice test -- pick A, B, or C. The factored
   version feels like a decision. The human is choosing what kind of
   reasoning to apply, not selecting from a menu.

## The Technique

### Step 1: Present alternatives normally

Generate or recognize the entangled options as they naturally arise.
This is the raw material -- defensible alternatives with principle and
exigence already fused.

### Step 2: Factor out the principle layer

Ask: what underlying value, priority, or methodological preference
differentiates these options? Name each principle in pure terms -- no
consequences, no situational detail. Just the stance.

The math: if A is the entangled option and P is the principle, then
A/P is the exigence -- the situation stripped of any stance on what to
do about it.

### Step 3: Rejoin principle and consequence

Show BOTH layers together. Each principle, followed by what it leads to
in this specific situation.

**Critical: the human must see both versions.** Principle alone is too
abstract -- the human cannot see where it leads. Consequence alone is the
entangled mess. Together they create clarity. This is not optional; it is
structural.

## Example

### Entangled (default)

> **Option 1: Signal extraction problem** -- People produce noisy input.
> Valuable intent gets lost. The product captures and structures signal.
>
> **Option 2: Help-seeking friction** -- The gap between needing help and
> getting help is too wide. The product collapses that gap.
>
> **Option 3: Coordination overhead** -- Small teams drown in alignment
> costs. The product eliminates that tax.

### Factored

> **Principle A: Fidelity** -- When in doubt, preserve the full signal of
> what someone means.
>
> -> This leads to the signal extraction problem. Communication is lossy;
> the product makes it lossless.
>
> **Principle B: Accessibility** -- When in doubt, lower the barrier to act.
>
> -> This leads to the help-seeking friction problem. The product collapses
> the gap between "I need help" and "I'm getting the right help."
>
> **Principle C: Efficiency** -- When in doubt, eliminate overhead.
>
> -> This leads to the coordination overhead problem. The product strips
> away the alignment tax so time goes to actual work.

### What happened next

The human saw these were not competing alternatives but three
complementary layers of one system. This was invisible in the entangled
form. The factoring dissolved the choice.

## When to Activate

- Any time you are about to present 2+ complex, defensible alternatives
- When a human is struggling to choose and the options all seem "fine"
- During vision workshops, architecture decisions, prioritization
- Trade-off discussions where each option is defensible
- When you catch yourself writing "here are your options" or "which
  approach do you prefer"

## Signals of Mastery

**Working well:**
- The human responds with sudden clarity ("these are layers, not choices")
- The human feels liberated -- reasoning freely without tiptoeing
- Structural relationships between options become visible
- The human chooses at the principle level with confidence
- The choice sometimes dissolves entirely

**Needs adjustment:**
- The human says "just tell me which one"
- Confusion increases rather than decreases
- The human asks for the simpler version back
- Principles feel abstract and disconnected from the situation

## The Exigence Can Arbitrate

When all principles are visible and defensible, the tiebreaker is the
concrete situation. The agent knows the methodology; the human knows the
values; the exigence is shared ground. Ask: "Which principle best serves
the exigence we're in right now?" This combines both sovereignties.

## The Technique Is Recursive

This technique applies to itself. When meta-questions about the technique
arise (scope, placement, framing), factor those into principles too. It
works at every level of abstraction.

## Pattern Boundary

This technique is most powerful for **principle-oriented thinkers** --
people who naturally reason from values and worldview rather than from
concrete feature comparison. Observe whether it lands. The signal is the
human's response: liberation and sudden structural insight means it is
working; "just tell me which one" means it is not the right tool for
this person in this moment.

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails |
|-------------|-------------|
| Principles without consequences | Too abstract -- the human cannot see where each principle leads |
| Consequences without principles | The entangled default -- the human cannot see what they are really choosing |
| Forcing a choice when factoring reveals complementarity | The factoring may dissolve the choice -- let it |
| Assuming all humans want declarative framing | Some prefer concrete options directly -- observe the response |
| Skipping step 1 (the entangled version) | The raw alternatives are the input to factoring; without them there is nothing to factor |

## Foundation

This skill is a manifestation of the **Two Sovereignties** principle:
separate WHAT (intent, principles, values) from HOW (implementation,
specifics, consequences). In decision-making, principles are the WHAT
and concrete alternatives are the HOW. The default presentation entangles
them; this technique factors them apart.

## Attribution

Discovered through lived co-creation during the sendhelp vision workshop
(2026-01-30). The technique emerged when a human asked for a complex
choice to be restated in "declarative terms" -- surfacing principles
separately from their consequences. The entangled original presented
three competing product directions; the factored version revealed three
complementary layers of one system. The technique then applied to itself
when meta-questions about skill design were factored the same way.
